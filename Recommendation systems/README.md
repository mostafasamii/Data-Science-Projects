# Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user
based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are
most likely to purchase and are of interest to companies use recommendation systems to help
their users to identify the correct product or movies for them

Recommendation systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content
based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach) as well as other systems such as
knowledge based systems

**Collaborative filtering** approaches build a model from a user’s past behavior as well as similar
decisions made by other users. This model is used to predict items (or rating for items) that the
user may have an interest in. It is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will
agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.
The system generates recommendations using only the information about rating profiles for
different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current
user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood

**Content based filtering** methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s
prefaces. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item
(name, location, description, .. etc) but not on the user.

In this project I am preforming **Content based filtering and Collaborative filtering**
